# ROS Code Makefile commands

!!! warning "Compatibility"
    Make is only preinstalled in Linux. On other operating systems, `make` needs to be manually installed.
    For Windows, I recommend using [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org) and running the following command:

    ```bat
    choco install make
    ```
