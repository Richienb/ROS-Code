Jython: Python for the Java Platform

Welcome to Jython 2.7.0!

This is the final release of the 2.7.0 version of Jython. Along with language
and runtime compatibility with CPython 2.7.0, Jython 2.7 provides substantial
support of the Python ecosystem. This includes built-in support of
pip/setuptools (you can use with bin/pip) and a native launcher for Windows
(bin/jython.exe), with the implication that you can finally install Jython
scripts on Windows.

Jim Baker presented a talk at PyCon 2015 about Jython 2.7, including
demos of new features: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hLm3garVQFo

The release was compiled on OSX using JDK 7 and requires a minimum of
Java 7 to run.
