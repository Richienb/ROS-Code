It\u2019s people like you that make ROS Code such a great tool. Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of the developers managing and developing this open source project. In return, they should reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue, assessing changes, and helping you finalize your pull requests. ROS Code is an open source project and we love to receive contributions from our community \u2014 you! There are many ways to contribute, improving the documentation, submitting bug reports and feature requests or writing code which can be incorporated into ROS Code itself. If your problem is not strictly specific to ROS Code, #python on Stack Overflow is generally more active. Responsibilities Ensure cross-platform compatibility for every change that\u2019s accepted. Windows, Mac, Debian & Ubuntu Linux. Ensure that code that goes into core meets all requirements outlined in the other contribution documents. Create issues for any major changes and enhancements that you wish to make. Discuss things transparently and get community feedback. Don\u2019t add any classes to the codebase unless absolutely needed. Err on the side of using functions. Keep feature versions as small as possible, preferably one new feature per version. Be welcoming to newcomers and encourage diverse new contributors from all backgrounds. See the Python Community Code of Conduct. Unsure where to begin contributing to ROS Code? You can start by looking through these beginner and help-wanted issues: Beginner issues - issues which should only require a few lines of code, and a test or two. Help wanted issues - issues which should be a bit more involved than beginner issues. Both issue lists are sorted by total number of comments. While not perfect, number of comments is a reasonable proxy for impact a given change will have. Working on your first Pull Request? You can learn how from this free series, How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub . At this point, you\u2019re ready to make your changes! Feel free to ask for help; everyone is a beginner at first \ud83d\ude38 If a maintainer asks you to \u201crebase\u201d your PR, they\u2019re saying that a lot of code has changed, and that you need to update your branch so it\u2019s easier to merge. For something that is bigger than a one or two line fix: Create your own fork of the code Do the changes in your fork If you like the change and think the project could use it: Be sure you have followed the code style for the project. Small contributions such as fixing spelling errors, where the content is small enough to not be considered intellectual property, can be submitted by a contributor as a patch, without a CLA. As a rule of thumb, changes are obvious fixes if they do not introduce any new functionality or creative thinking. As long as the change does not affect functionality, some likely examples include the following: Spelling / grammar fixes Typo correction, white space and formatting changes Comment clean up Bug fixes that change default return values or error codes stored in constants Adding logging messages or debugging output Changes to \u2018metadata\u2019 files like Gemfile, .gitignore, build scripts, etc. Moving source files from one directory or package to another If you find a security vulnerability, do NOT open an issue. Email richiebendall@gmail.com instead. When filing an issue, make sure to answer these five questions: What version of Python are you using (python \u2013version)? What operating system and processor architecture are you using? What did you do? What did you expect to see? What did you see instead? You can chat with the core team on Gitter or Discord .

The term of this Public License is specified in Section 6(a). Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created, and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or authority to forbid You from making technical modifications necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License, simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)(4) never produces Adapted Material. Downstream recipients. A. Offer from the Licensor \u2013 Licensed Material. Every recipient of the Licensed Material automatically receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this Public License. B. No downstream restrictions.

Other rights. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity, privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed Rights, but not otherwise. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this Public License. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly reserves any right to collect such royalties. Section 3 \u2013 License Conditions. Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the following conditions. a. Attribution. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified form), You must: A. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor with the Licensed Material: i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed Material and any others designated to receive attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by the Licensor (including by pseudonym if designated); ii. a copyright notice; iii. a notice that refers to this Public License; iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of warranties; v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the extent reasonably practicable; B. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and retain an indication of any previous modifications; and C. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, this Public License. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or hyperlink to a resource that includes the required information. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent reasonably practicable. If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter\u2019s License You apply must not prevent recipients of the Adapted Material from complying with this Public License. Section 4 \u2013 Sui Generis Database Rights. Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material: a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database; b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material; and c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database. For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights. Section 5 \u2013 Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability. a. Unless otherwise separately undertaken by the Licensor, to the extent possible, the Licensor offers the Licensed Material as-is and as-available, and makes no representations or warranties of any kind concerning the Licensed Material, whether express, implied, statutory, or other. This includes, without limitation, warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the presence or absence of errors, whether or not known or discoverable. Where disclaimers of warranties are not allowed in full or in part, this disclaimer may not apply to You. b. To the extent possible, in no event will the Licensor be liable to You on any legal theory (including, without limitation, negligence) or otherwise for any direct, special, indirect, incidental, consequential, punitive, exemplary, or other losses, costs, expenses, or damages arising out of this Public License or use of the Licensed Material, even if the Licensor has been advised of the possibility of such losses, costs, expenses, or damages. Where a limitation of liability is not allowed in full or in part, this limitation may not apply to You. c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and waiver of all liability. Section 6 \u2013 Term and Termination. a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License terminate automatically. b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under Section 6(a), it reinstates: automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation; or upon express reinstatement by the Licensor. For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations of this Public License. c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so will not terminate this Public License. d. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public License. Section 7 \u2013 Other Terms and Conditions. a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed. b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License. Section 8 \u2013 Interpretation. a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully be made without permission under this Public License. b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and conditions. c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the Licensor. d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal processes of any jurisdiction or authority.

Step 2: Release type If the code is in it\u2019s early stages ie. the code isn\u2019t ready or doesn\u2019t work yet then it is considered alpha , If the code is runnable but isn\u2019t quite complete then it is considered beta , and If the code is in a stable state then it is considered stable . Step 3: What part of the version to increment Increment the Major version when you make incompatible API changes, Increment the Minor version when you add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner, and Increment the Patch version when you make backwards-compatible bug fixes. Step 4: Create the release If a alpha version will be released, a descriptive title and description is not required but must contain a short title. The format for the version number should resemble this example: 2.23.1-alpha . If it is the second or more consecutive alpha release then follow this example: 2.23.1-alpha.2 . If a beta version will be released, a descriptive title is required but a description is optional. The format for the version number should resemble this example: 2.23.1-beta . If it is the second or more consecutive alpha release then follow this example: 2.23.1-beta.2 . If a stable version will be released, ensure a suitable title and description is chosen. The format for the version number should resemble this example: 2.23.1 . Step 5: Bump the version in the configuration file After the release is live, edit the current_version section of the .bumpversion.cfg file in the root of the repository to match the latest version number.
